        <h3>Why Barcelona?</h3>
        <h2>Barcelona, a Cosmopolitan City</h2>
        <p>
          Barcelona is a city with a wide range of original leisure options that
          encourage you to visit time and time again. Overlooking the
          Mediterranean Sea, and famous for Gaudí and other Art Nouveau
          architecture, Barcelona is one of Europe’s trendiest cities. It’s a
          hub of new trends in the world of culture, fashion and cuisine. It
          combines the creativity of its artists and designers with respect and
          care for local traditions. The charm and slower pace of the old town,
          the avant-garde vibe of more modern neighbourhoods, and the fast pace
          of one of the world’s most visited cities coexist in Barcelona.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is impossible to speak about Barcelona without mentioning any work
          by Antoni Gaudí. Just like thinking about the genius of modernist
          architecture without associating him with images of the Catalonian
          capital. The architect’s distinctive style is part of the city’s
          identity. His decorative elegance and colourful mosaics (“trencadís”
          in Catalan) appear when you least expect them. Barcelona and Gaudí are
          inseparable.
