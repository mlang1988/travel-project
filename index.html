        <h3>Why Barcelona?</h3>
        <h2>Barcelona, a Cosmopolitan City</h2>
        <p>
          Barcelona is a city with a wide range of original leisure options that
          encourage you to visit time and time again. Overlooking the
          Mediterranean Sea, and famous for Gaudí and other Art Nouveau
          architecture, Barcelona is one of Europe’s trendiest cities. It’s a
          hub of new trends in the world of culture, fashion and cuisine. It
          combines the creativity of its artists and designers with respect and
          care for local traditions. The charm and slower pace of the old town,
          the avant-garde vibe of more modern neighbourhoods, and the fast pace
          of one of the world’s most visited cities coexist in Barcelona.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is impossible to speak about Barcelona without mentioning any work
          by Antoni Gaudí. Just like thinking about the genius of modernist
          architecture without associating him with images of the Catalonian
          capital. The architect’s distinctive style is part of the city’s
          identity. His decorative elegance and colourful mosaics (“trencadís”
          in Catalan) appear when you least expect them. Barcelona and Gaudí are
          inseparable.

        <p>
          The Sagrada Familia one of the most famous works of architect Antoni
          Gaudí, the greatest exponent of Catalan modernism, and an essential
          part of the Barcelona skyline, which is one of the most frequently
          visited monuments in Spain
        </p>
        <h5>Address:</h5>
        <p>Carrer Mallorca, 401</p>
        <h5>What I like about it:</h5>
        <p>
          If there is only one place you can visit, this is the one. It is one
          of the most awe-inspiring buildings you will ever visit!
